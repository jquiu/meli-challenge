# MELI CHALLENGE

According to the challenge, I made the decision to do it with NextJs (React framework), in order to take advantage of the rendering on the server-side. From this way, the weight of the processing and creation of the pages would be on it. With this technique, we also think of SEO optimization. 
About component styles, I chose to use the styled-components library as it creates dynamic and useful components.

## :rocket: BUILD
# I use a number of open source libraries to work properly:
- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as javascript framework build in react.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/) as a Node framework.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) mapping between components and styles.
- [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) to testing.
