# BUILD
# I use a number of open source libraries to work properly:
- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/)

I have made the decision to create the app in next js to be able to have all the react aspects and the server side rendering functionality, styled-components is a library that allows us to style our React components and we like it so much because it creates us a component, and at the same time that we define its styles, we can also condition them to the properties we want.
